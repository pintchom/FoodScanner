AUCHEVAL,true,"Yes. The food contains seed oils, specifically because the mayonnaise, which is served with the fries, uses canola oil as stated in the report."
MORANDI,true,"Yes, the food pictured likely contains seed oils. The image shows French fries, and according to the report you provided, fried foods at this establishment are made using canola oil, which is a seed oil."
WAVERLYINN,true,"Yes, it's likely that the food contains seed oils. The note in the report about everything being in canola oil suggests that both the steak and the potatoes, as depicted in the image, might have been prepared using canola oil, which is a common type of seed oil. The appearance of the shiny texture on the potatoes and possibly on the steak further supports the use of oil in cooking."
