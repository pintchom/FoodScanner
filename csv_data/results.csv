WAVERLYINN,true,"Yes, it's likely that the food contains seed oils. The note in the report about everything being in canola oil suggests that both the steak and the potatoes, as depicted in the image, might have been prepared using canola oil, which is a common type of seed oil. The appearance of the shiny texture on the potatoes and possibly on the steak further supports the use of oil in cooking."
